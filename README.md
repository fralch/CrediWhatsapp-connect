 
 # WhatsApp Service Library



A JavaScript library that simplifies the initialization and management of WhatsApp Web services using `whatsapp-web.js` and `puppeteer`. It provides an easy-to-use interface for handling authentication, generating QR codes as images, and enabling users to perform additional actions programmatically, such as sending messages.
